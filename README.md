## Problem Statement

Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth. 

Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the Evs. 

Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) & Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset


### Summary for Steps followed 
1. **Collecting Data:**
   Taken the data from kaggle.
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population

2. **Loading Data into Power BI:**
   - Next, we took all the answers and put them into a program called Power BI. We used an CSV file to store this information.

3. **Checking Data in Power Query Editor:**
   - We looked closely at the data in Power BI using something called Power Query Editor. In this editor, we checked various options to understand the data better.

4. **Making Sure to See All Data:**
   - Usually, Power BI shows details for only a limited number of responses. We wanted to see details of entire dataset, so we made sure to look at the information provided.

5. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Since the information we got was a bit messy, we spent time fixing and organizing it to make sure it's accurate and useful.

6. **Data Visualization**
   - After cleaning up the information, we started making visual images, like charts and graphs, using Power BI. These visuals help us see and understand the EV data about the market trend and the largest producer of EV cars in a simpler way.
